It's crucial to have an understanding of the basics of statistics for you to succeed at any data science interview. A great deal of parametric statistical testing makes some basic assumptions, most importantly that the variables are normally distributed. This is based on the Central limit theorem (CLT) which states that with a large enough sample size, the distribution of sample means are approximately normally distributed. 

1. <b> Descriptive Statistics </b>
 
Explains the basics of a distribution including: 
* Central Tendency 
  - Mean 
  - Median 
  - Mode 

* Disepersion 
  - Range (min and max of distribution) 
  - Variance or Standard Deviation (sqrt (Variance))

2. <b> p-value </b>
	- Confidence that two distributions are actually different 
	- Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis 
	- p= 0.05 means that 5% of the time you run an experiment you get a false positive. 
	- p-values don't give us an understanding of HOW different the two treatments are 
	  - Does NOT give us an understanding of the effect size 
	- Calculation of the p-values are the sum of 3 parts: 
		1. The probability that random chance results in the observation 
		2. The proabbility of observing something equally as rare 
		3. The probabibility of observing something even more extreme 

3. <b> Error Bars: </b>  <i> Standard deviation, Standard error, Confidence Intervals </i>
